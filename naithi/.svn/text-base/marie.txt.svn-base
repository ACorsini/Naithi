Marie ní Bhriain

We were saddened to hear the news of the death of Marie ní Bhriain. Maire was a good friend and supporter of Craobh Naithi as a parent and a committee member for many years. As Treoraí na Gaeilge she brought to the branch her interest in the language and its culture. With her husband Muiris she took part in many of the trips and she was a member of the branches first senior grupai cheol. Her love of the music was displayed by her regular attendance at the ‘Rosie’s’ sessions, her trips abroad and by the encouragement of her children to take part in branch activities. A warm person, she will be missed by many.
