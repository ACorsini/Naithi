		<h1>Welcome to Craobh Naithí</h1>
			<p>Craobh Naithí, based in south County Dublin, was established in 1976. It is one of the largest and most active branches across the entire Comhaltas network.</p>
			<p>Craobh Naithí presents a weekly programme of music classes, with 25 teachers and 450 class places.  Instruments taught include fiddle, flute, tin whistle, tenor banjo,
			button and piano accordion, concertina, harp and sean nós singing.</p>
			<p>It is the policy of Craobh Naithí that traditional music is taught and played in a pure
			 traditional style.  Classes are held each Thursday evening from September to May 
			 in St. Colmcille’s Community School, Scholarstown Road, Knocklyon.</p>
			<p>Other branch activities include 5 x one hour grúpaí cheoil classes to develop performance
			 playing, participation at events such as fleadhanna cheoil and Oireachtas na Gaeilge
			 competitions, regular branch sessions, weekend visits to other Comhaltas branches in Ireland
			 and abroad and support to local cultural events such as Seachtain na Gaeilge and Wren Boys.</p> 
			<p>In addition, Ceardlann an Fhómhair, Craobh Naithí‘s annual traditional music weekend of workshops
			 and performances by prominent visiting musicians, takes place each October.  
                Ceardlann an Fhómhair 2012
			 will be our 17th consecutive year.</p>
