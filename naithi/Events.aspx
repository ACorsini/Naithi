        <p class="body_events">On Saturday 26th March the exciting new Trad band FullSet
        delighted their audience with a great night of music and songs. It was held in
        Marley Parish Centre, promoted by the branch, and one of a series of Concerts
        to introduce the best musicians to our members and their friends.</p>

    <p class="body_events">They played a wide selection of tunes interspersed with songs
        from Teresa Horgan. Much of the material appears on their recently released CD
        which was on sale on the night.</p>
   <p class="body_events">FullSet has a strong connection to Craobh Naithí since two
         of their members are branch teachers and Janine learned her music with us.</p>
    <p class="body_events">The committee provided a tasty light supper which ended
    a very enjoyable night.</p>
    <p class="body_events">FullSet members are Seán McCarthy - Uilleann pipes, Whistles; 
    Teresa Horgan - Flute, Vocals; Andy Meaney – Guitar; Michael Harrison – Fiddle;

        St. Patrick’s Day</p>
        <p class="body_events">

        <p class="body_events">On the eve (March 16) as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge we were invited
        by Ceantar Naithí to take part in an Oiche Gaeilge. We joined Pio and the House band
        for some lively tune sets and songs. Seamus Mac Mathúna sang in both Irish
        and English as did Ray McDonald and a delightful evening was spent in happy companionship.</p>
        <p class="body_events">On the morning of the day itself we provided music for the
        Irish Mass in St. John's in Ballinteer and after a cup of tea, 
        for St. Attracta’s Irish Mass.</p>

       <p class="h3_events">Scoil Fhómhair 2010</p>
           <p class="body_events">Every year the branch organizes a weekend to give members 
           the opportunity to steep themselves in the music. Through classes, a session, a 
           recital and a concert, they experience learning from – and listening to some
            of the finest of traditional musicians. Scoil Fhómhair 2010 took place on 15 - 16th October and was the 15th in the series.</p>
        <p class="body_events">The Opening session in Faughs GAA on Friday night had a large attendance. The guest musicians were Conal Ó Gráda, Paudie O’Connor and Jack Talty.</p>
    <p class="body_events">&nbsp;60 musicians participated in workshops in St. Colmcille’s Community School on Saturday 16th October. Classes in Flute were by 
        <b>John Wynne</b> (Roscommon) and <b>Conal Ó Gráda</b> (Cork).
             In Fiddle by <b>Aoife O’Keefe</b> (Kerry); <b>Conor McEvoy
        </b>(Meath) <b>MacDarragh O Raghaille</b> (Meath) 
             and <b>Jacqui Martin</b> (North County Dublin). The Tin Whistle class had 
        <b>Maureen McGrattan</b>. 
             The Concertina was taught by <b>Jack Talty</b> (Clare) and 
        <b>Mairéad Hurley</b> (Sligo). 
             <b>Paudie O’Connor</b> (Ballyhar, Kerry) was Accordion tutor.</p>
            <p class="body_events">All the tutors performed in an excellent lunch-time recital enjoyed by the 
            students and friends.</p>
            <p class="body_events">The Divine Word Parish Centre proved to be an excellent venue 
            for the evening concert. A fantastic evening of music was enjoyed by an appreciative 
            audience of approximately 60.</p>
            <p class="body_events">The Chairman and Committee wish to thank Fuaghs GAA Club, the principal of St. Colmcille’s 
            Community School, The Divine Word Parish Centre for providing help and accommodation

       <p class="h3_events">Green Book Tutorial CD</p>
           <p class="body_events">Craobh Naithi's "Green" and "Yellow" tune books have formed the basis of
           our young pupils' repertoires for over 15 years and the development of the tutorial
           CD set of the yellow book in 2007 was a valuable learning aid for both our own young musicians
            and traditional musicians and teachers in general.</p> 
           <p class="body_events">In 2010, Croabh Naithi set about completing this educational suite and
            commenced the production of a tutorial CD set to accompany the green book. Recordings are
             now complete and we plan to launch the product later this year.</p>

            <p class="body_events">It has become tradition in the branch for many years now, the final
                night of classes in May is replaced by a concert featuring all the junior grúpai cheoil
                and ceili bands that performed in Fleadh Atha Cliath.</p> 
           <p class="body_events">Four grúpai cheoil and four céilí bands performed their fleadh pieces
                for an appreciative audience of parents, family and friends in St. Colmcille's
               Community School. The concert also included performances from singers and dancers.</p>
           <p class="body_events">Once again, a group comprising about 60 of our youngest pupils, many
            of whom were performing in public for the first time, took to the stage and performed with
             style.</p>

           <p class="h3_events">The trip to Kilnaleck</p>
           <p class="body_events">On a beautiful evening on the 4th June, 2010 members of the branch set off from Dublin on a trip to
           the Co. Cavan Fleadh. The mission was to deliver the ‘Eddie McCaffrey Perpetual Trophy’. It had been decided to honour 
           our Branch president’s name by presenting a cup to the Cavan Board for their Under 18 button accordion competition. 
           It was the instrument Eddie had a great love of.</p>
           <p class="body_events">The coach journeyed through the beautiful Cavan countryside after making use of the new stretch of motorway
           that had only been officially opened that very afternoon. After pausing beside Lough Ramor
           for a comfort stop and a view over the water we reached Kilnaleck. 
           The dignitaries had just opened the event and Phillip Clarke (piano –accordionist and MC
           for the night) arranged the presentation of the trophy to the Fleadh chairman Betty Ledd by
           Eithne, Eddie’s widow and Aoife his grand daughter. The McCaffrey family were well
           represented by daughter and husband Gráinne and Paddy Smith), grandsons Oisín and Fiachre;
           Eddies sister and brother in law Carmel and Gerard O'Keeffe and Eithne's sister and brother in law Dierdre and Paddy Greene.
           <p class="body_events">Philip had spotted Seamus Mac Mathuna among the recent Craobh Naithí
           arrivals and invited him to entertain the audience with a song. Philip then invited our musicians to join with locals
           on the stage. Since we equalled in numbers the residents it was a bit of a squeeze but everyone was eventually accommodated 
           and struck up with some vigorous jigs and reels and the odd hornpipe. To close the official
           part of the evening Seamus was invited to sing again but he nominated Aoife (Eddie’s granddaughter) to sing in his place. 
           Which she delightfully did.</p>
           <p class="body_events">The musicians were then invited to cross the street where Boylan’s would provide
           complementary drinks and a lively session ensued.</p> 
           <p class="body_events">The schedule had us down to leave at midnight but things were going so well that it was
           some time after that the chipper search party were underway. An hour and twenty minuets saw us back at the Spawell
           just as dawn was breaking.</p>
           <p class="body_events">We’d like to express our thanks for the warm welcome we received from the Cavan people and hope to meet them again — in August? 
           And of course to Derek and Padraig for the organisation.

		<h3 class="h3_events">Craobh Naithí trip to <br />New York October 2009</h3>
		<p class="body_events">Craobh Naithí’s first branch visit to the United states took place in 
October 2009 with 60 members enjoying a fantastic week of music and friendship.</p>
<p class="body_events">The New York City branch, Craobh Úll Mór, was very supportive 
of our trip and worked very closely with Craobh Naithí to bring the whole idea to fruition.</p>
<p class="body_events">In return for their support, Craobh Naithí presented a two hour fundraising concert in the New York Irish Centre in Long Island City, Queens, on their behalf.</p>  
<p class="body_events">Craobh Naithí also performed at the Irish Hunger Memorial in Battery Park City,
 Manhattan and the performance was filmed by the local Battery Park TV network. 
  Both events received positive reviews from the New York based Irish Voice newspaper.</p>
<p class="body_events">Later in the week, we travelled to Pearl River where we delivered a 
number of instrumental and dancing workshops to children from the Martin Mulvihill / 
Michael Coleman branches, which was followed by an evening of music, song and dance
 at the Rockland County Irish American Centre.</p> 
<p class="body_events">Martin Gaffney, PRO for Fleadh Cheoil na Éireann in Cavan and a 
Craobh Naithí  availed of numerous opportunities while in the New York area to 
promote next year’s event.</p>  
<p class="body_events">The trip brought together musicians of all age groups from both sides
 of the Atlantic who shared music and stories and created friendships which I hope
  will develop and grow.</p>  
<p class="body_events">At the closing session in the New York Irish Centre on the last night of 
the tour, Maureen Donachie, Chairperson of Craobh Úll Mor, presented a ‘Friends of Úll Mór’
 shield to Derek Johnston, Chairperson of Craobh Naithí and expressed the wish that 
 both branches maintain contact.</p>
